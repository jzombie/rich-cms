# Proof That We Are Information

The very fact that matter is shaped any shape at all is because it contains information... information exchanged between particles that describe every property about that matter.
The universe is constantly seeking to maximize randomness....  entropy.

Information is therefore resistance to entropy.

Noise is entropy.

A signal is lack of entropy.

Life fights the very force of the universe trying to maximize entropy because if we were just scattered particles we would be dead.

Now, there are non living things that are also matter, but whether they are scattered or not does not affect the fact that they are not living, and since all things eventually progress towards a maximum state of entropy, even they will be scattered in time.

But living things cannot be in a max state of entropy, as it takes complex structure to sustain life.

So life is resistance to entropy.

And resistance to entropy is information, as otherwise it would be noise.

So we are information, because otherwise we would be dead.
