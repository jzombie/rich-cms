# 12 Laws of Karma

## THE GREAT LAW
Whatever energy and thoughts you put out to the Universe, you get back, be it good or bad.

## THE LAW OF CREATION
Life won't just happen to you. You need to take action and make things happen, rather than wait for everything to magically work out for you.

## THE LAW OF HUMILITY
Being humble enough to accept and understand that your current situation is a result of your past actions.

## THE LAW OF GROWTH
Control yourself, not others, and focus on your own personal growth, as real change starts with you.

## THE LAW OF FOCUS
Focus on one thing at a time, and as long as your focus is on spiritual values, you won't have any greedy and negative thoughts.

## THE LAW OF GIVING & HOSPITALITY
Give to the things you believe in from your heart. Understand and acknowledge that your actions are a reflection of your inherent beliefs.

## THE LAW OF RESPONSIBILITY
Whatever happens in your life, it happens because of you, and you need to own it. You are the choices you make.

## THE LAW OF CONNECTION
Your past, present, and future, everything is connected. Your past actions determine who you are today, and your present will decide who you will be tomorrow.

## THE LAW OF HERE AND NOW
Living in the present moment is the only way to be truly happy. Holding on to the past and obsessing about the future will only make you unhappy.

## THE LAW OF CHANGE
History keeps on repeating itself unless you learn your lessons and change your life. If you notice dramatic changes, it means you are growing.

## THE LAW OF PATIENCE & REWARD
Success requires patience, consistent hard work, and the self-assurance that you will get the rewards for your efforts.

## THE LAW OF SIGNIFICANCE & INSPIRATION
Be it big or small, every contribution you make influences the Universe. Your positive actions will bring more positivity into your life.
