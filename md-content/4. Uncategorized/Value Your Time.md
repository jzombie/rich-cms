# Value Your Time

Your job doesn't pay for your work, it rents your life.

Everything else is either a welcomed guest, or a freeloader.

Make the distinction. Who will you let in?

What do they offer in return? Is it worth what you're giving up?

You've got limited acreage and it shrinks with every passing second.

Your time is premium real estate, not a slum.

Develop it into something you can be proud of, not something you want to forget.

Build.

Diversify.

Increase the value.

Invest in yourself.
