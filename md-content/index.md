Rich CMS is an experimental Markdown-driven content management system, written in Python.

It outputs static HTML files that can be used locally without a web server, served via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), etc.

I envision this project to eventually become sort of a "database of personal thoughts" that I don't mind sharing with the world.
