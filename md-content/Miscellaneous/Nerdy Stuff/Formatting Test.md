## Example Monetary Value

$15,000,000 is the value...

b. SHELTER. This family lives in a comfortable apartment, heated by steam, lighted with electricity, with gas for cooking, all for $65.00 a month. In a smaller city, or a more sparsely settled part of New York city, the same apartment could be had for as low as $20.00 a month.

## Example Equation

This is a simple equation: $E=mc^2$

## Another Equation

And here's a more complex equation:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du \right) = f(x)
$$
