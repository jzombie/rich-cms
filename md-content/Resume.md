### Software Engineer
**CoinSmart - Full-time**  
*Mar 2022 - Jul 2023 | 1 yr 5 mos*  
Toronto, Ontario, Canada | Remote

- Helped drive increased revenue, user engagement, and retention by building out a price alert system, which comprised of several Docker-based microservices using a Firebase backend.
- Integrated translation by adding i18next into the React website, including building some tooling to automate part of the translation process, ensuring our language tokens were consistent, and not duplicated, across all languages, and that 100% of them were incorporated into the site.
- Strengthened team security by implementing 1Password integrations across a significant portion of our development stack.
- Ported the AlphaPoint (crypto exchange platform) SDK to TypeScript, documenting the process and adding extensive unit tests. We originally had multiple implementations of the AlphaPoint connector, across mobile, web, and various backend services, and this approach helped unify that.
- Ported our TypeScript API SDK into Python and also wrote example authenticators, with unit tests, in Ruby and PHP.
- Fostered a collaborative and supportive team environment by always trying to help a team member in need.

- Helped the company financially, by implementing a critical piece of software that would fulfill one of our largest contractual obligations. This involved constructing a WebRTC bridge integrating live, video-based translation services into our own telehealthcare calls. The translation service did not originally have a WebRTC connector, and my bridge fixed that gap.
- Transitioned our telecommunications platform from Jitsi to Twilio, ensuring a seamless user experience, in the peak of the Covid crisis.
- Actively participated in the decision to use a mono-repo, and/or sharable modules, for sharing code between our multiple frontend and mobile apps.
- We were incentivized to move fast and PRs never sat in code review for more than 15 minutes before someone (such as me) was looking at them.

**Skills:** JavaScript · React.js · Github · Linux · Apollo GraphQL · WebRTC · Git · Docker · Socket.io · Twilio
