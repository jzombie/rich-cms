# TODO

- [] Fix issue where "?" in MD names causes broken links
- [] Add breadcrumb links
- [] Test local links vs hosted (perhaps ditch locally hosted method; very problematic to debug)
- [] Highlight active link
- [] Add unit tests
- [] Make it easy to add images
- [] Add simple Docker example that spits out a static website from a directory of markdown files
- [] Live content update as markdown content is changed
- [] Adding search would be nice
- [] Sitemap and RSS
- [] Include download links to original Markdown files?
- [] [maybe?] Add pydantic for string replacements?
