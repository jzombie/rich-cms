# TODO

- [] Show word count after compilation step
- [] The ability to hotlink to a particular paragraph would be nice
- [] Ability to make an article not be included in TOC; i.e. for 404 pages
- [] Use font "very similar" to that used in Google Play Books
- [] Fix issue where "?" in MD names causes broken links
- [] Add sub-headings into table of contents (TOC)
- [] Add breadcrumb links
- [] Test local links vs hosted (perhaps ditch locally hosted method; very problematic to debug)
- [] Highlight active link
- [] Add unit tests
- [] Make it easy to add images
- [] Add simple Docker example that spits out a static website from a directory of markdown files
- [] Live content update as markdown content is changed
- [] Adding search would be nice
- [] Sitemap and RSS (this may require using a separate metadata file to keep track of file creations/modifications, unless somehow able to source through git [or just using hardcoded metadata keys -> easy])
- [] Include download links to original Markdown files? (if so, slightly modified to include main document title, hierarchy, or link)
- [] Add word count and estimated reading time to meta data
- [] Metadata for sharing w/ social media; SEO
- [] [maybe?] Add pydantic for string replacements?
