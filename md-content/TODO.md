# TODO

- [] Implement custom sort ordering for files/directories (use a separate file to specify absolute list positioning?)
- [] Ability to make an article not be included in TOC; i.e. for 404 pages
- [] Fix issue where long links can cause horizontal overflow on mobile
- [] Need persistent "home" link
- [] History tracking would be nice (but wouldn't sync w/o having some sort of backend, which is not a goal I have in mind; could a QR code suffice, somehow??)
- [X] Fix "Chapter 7" mobile horizontal overflow issue (see "personal reading list")
- [] Add sub-headings into table of contents (TOC) (navigation similar to: https://finalfusion.github.io/)
- [X] Fix TOC issue on mobile where it cannot be scrolled vertically
- [] Parse & include site name in title / header
- [X] Sanitize strings / prevent XSS
- [X] Default "index.md" to top of navigation, per directory
- [] <- -> article navigation, w/ titles
- [] Includes via env variables (i.e. for tracking, etc.)
- [] Show word count after compilation step
- [] The ability to hotlink to a particular paragraph would be nice
- [X] Use font "very similar" to that used in Google Play Books
- [] Fix issue where "?" in MD names causes broken links
- [] Add links to headings (including hover links)
- [] Add breadcrumb links
- [X] Highlight active link
- [] Add [more] unit tests
- [] Make it easy to add images
- [] Add simple Docker example that spits out a static website from a directory of markdown files
- [PROBABLY-WON'T-DO] [] Live content update as markdown content is changed
- [] Adding search would be nice
- [] Sitemap and RSS (this may require using a separate metadata file to keep track of file creations/modifications, unless somehow able to source through git [or just using hardcoded metadata keys -> easy])
- [] Include download links to original Markdown files? (if so, slightly modified to include main document title, hierarchy, or link)
- [] Add word count and estimated reading time to meta data
- [] Metadata for sharing w/ social media; SEO
- [] [maybe?] Add pydantic for string replacements?
