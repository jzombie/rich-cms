# Biggest Mistake You Can Make

A gentle reminder for you:

(In case you've felt stuck)

The biggest mistake you can make is avoid making mistakes

*Read that again*

That's why I'm here to remind you:

You don't need more information
You don't need more preparation
You don't need more education
You don't need more hesitation
You don't need more validation

You have all the answers

You just need to prove the world wrong

And yourself right.
