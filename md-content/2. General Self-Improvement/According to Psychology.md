# According to Psychology

Your mind is always looking for proof of *what you believe*. If you tell yourself things always go wrong, your brain will focus on every setback and inconvenience to confirm that story. It's not that life is worse--it's just your brain doing its job, reinforcing the narrative you've chosen.

But there's the good news: it works the other way, too. If you start asking, "How can things get better?" or "What good is happening in my life?" your brain will look for those answers. It will notice small wins, moments of growth, and opportunities, shifting your perspective toward hope and positivity.

This is confirmation bias in action. Your mind finds evidence to match the reality you believe in. So, be mindful of the story you're telling yourself. The way you frame your experiences today shapes how you'll see your life tomorrow.
