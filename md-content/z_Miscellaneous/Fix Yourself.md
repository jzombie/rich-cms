Ask yourself this question if you want to know something about yourself:

- **Self-Reflection**: Sit on your bed one night.
- **Self-Questioning**: And say to yourself, "What's one thing I'm doing wrong?"
- **Self-Awareness**: That I know I'm doing wrong?
- **Possibility of Change**: That I could fix, that I would fix.
- **Meditation on the Question**: You meditate on that...
- **Receiving the Answer**: You'll get an answer.
- **Accepting the Truth**: And it won't be one you want, but it'll be the necessary one.
