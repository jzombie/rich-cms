## Anyone Can Do It

- **Anne Mahlum of Solidcore**:
  - Emphasized persistence and hard work.
  - "The biggest thing I’ve learned through Solidcore is: You can do whatever you want to do, as long as you’re willing to do it." She made $88.4 million from her business.

## Lean Into What Makes You Unique
- **Anne Mahlum**:
  - Highlighted the importance of leveraging individual strengths and uniqueness for success.

- **Edward Tirtanata of Kopi Kenangan**:
  - Advised entrepreneurs to differentiate themselves.
  - "I think the best advice that I can give to fellow entrepreneurs is to be different. The next Starbucks is not going to look like a Starbucks, the next McDonald’s is not gonna look like a McDonald’s. The next Google is not going to look like a Google – you need to be radically different in order for you to compete against the incumbent." His coffee chain has over 800 locations and significant annual revenue.

## Be Passionate
- **Shawn Tsao of Caviar**:
  - Stressed genuine passion for the product as a driving force through challenges.
  - "If you’re an entrepreneur and you’re really passionate about the product that you’re building — not because you just want the glory of being a CEO or a founder [but] you’re really passionate about what you’re working on — that will get you through the hardest days." His passion for sandwiches led to a successful food-delivery service sold for over $100 million.

## Just Get Started
- **Jason McGowan and Anne Mahlum**:
  - Emphasized the importance of taking action and starting, even without complete resources or knowledge.
  - "One of the biggest lessons that I’ve learned from starting Crumbl is just to get started. Whether you don’t have a mixer yet, or you don’t have a recipe for a cookie, you just get started — you start doing things, you start moving," McGowan shared.
  - "Nike got it best, to ‘just do it.’ I have a phrase that says: ‘Just have a day one,’" Mahlum added. Early-stage action is crucial for building momentum.

## Common Themes
- Belief in oneself and potential for success.
- Willingness to take risks and make sacrifices.
