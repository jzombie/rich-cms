    <p class="has-drop-cap">
     Living with ADD, I understand the importance of maintaining focus and productivity. However, my experience with Evernote lately has been more of a distraction than a support. The constant interruptions by paywalls not only disrupt my workflow but also cause me to lose track of my initial purpose for using the app. It feels as if the app is more focused on monetizing than providing a seamless user experience. Adding to this frustration is the fact that the web clipper interferes with my browser’s console when I’m debugging web apps. Moreover, the Android client refuses to capture notes unless I reinstall it each time.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the focus is solely on making money, perhaps it’s time to reconsider the approach.

     The Downfalls of Evernote
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Poor Performance and Buggy
      </strong>
      : Evernote has become slow and buggy over time, affecting my productivity and overall user experience. This could be due to outdated technology or lack of optimization, but either way, it’s a significant drawback.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Syncing Issues
      </strong>
      : Note synchronization across different devices, a critical feature for a note-taking app, has become unreliable. This has significantly impacted my trust in the app and its reliability.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Restrictive Device Limitations
      </strong>
      : Evernote has imposed restrictions on the number of devices that can be used simultaneously on certain plans. This has been frustrating as I often need to access my notes across multiple devices.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Pricing and Monetization Strategy
      </strong>
      : Evernote’s pricing strategy has changed over time, and not for the better. The value I get from the service no longer justifies the cost — and I’m not even paying for it.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Loss of Core Features
      </strong>
      : Evernote has removed or limited some of its core features, such as the ability to export notes and the inclusion of reminders without needing to connect to Google or Outlook.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Lack of Innovation
      </strong>
      : While competitors have introduced new features and integrations, Evernote seems to be stuck in time. The company doesn’t appear to be innovating or updating its service to keep up with user expectations and market trends.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Leadership Changes
      </strong>
      : Frequent changes in leadership have led to inconsistency in vision and strategy, which may have contributed to some of the issues I’ve experienced with Evernote.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-simplicity-and-efficiency-of-markdown">
     The Simplicity and Efficiency of Markdown
    </h2>
    <p>
     In light of these issues, I’ve decided to switch to a simpler, more efficient solution: a markdown format in a GitHub repo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here’s why:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Free
      </strong>
      : No nagging paywalls. Plus I can store the data wherever I want.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Simplicity
      </strong>
      : Markdown is easy to learn and use. It’s a straightforward way to format text, without the need for complex tools or software.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Flexibility
      </strong>
      : With markdown, I can create and edit notes on any device. There are no device limitations or syncing issues to worry about.
Control: Using a GitHub repo for my notes gives me complete control over my data. I can easily export my notes, and I don’t have to worry about changes in pricing or features.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Collaboration
      </strong>
      : GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with others, whether it’s sharing notes or working on a project together.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Version Control
      </strong>
      : With GitHub, every change is tracked. This means I can see the history of my notes and easily revert back to a previous version if needed.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     In conclusion, while Evernote has its merits, the recent issues have made it clear that it’s not the best solution for me. By switching to a markdown format in a GitHub repo, I’m hoping to simplify my note-taking process and improve my productivity. If you’re also frustrated with Evernote, it might be worth considering a similar switch.
