    <blockquote>
     <p>
      "[...] I often tell my clients, especially young people. They say, 'well, I don't know what to do.' It's like, that's okay, nobody does. Go do something. Do the best thing that you can think of. Put the best plan you have into practice. It's not going to be perfect, and it will change along the way, but it will change partly because you become disciplined pursuing the path, and as you become disciplined you become wiser, and as you become wiser you become able to formulate better and better plans." ~ Jordan Peterson
     </p>
     <p>
      "If you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy." ~ Dale Carnegie
     </p>
     <p>
      "Reading an hour a day is only 4% of your day. But that 4% will put you at the top of your field within 10 years. Find the time." ~ Patrick Bet-David
     </p>
     <p>
      "Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again." ~ Steve Jobs
     </p>
     <p>
      "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it... he who doesn't... pays it." ~ Albert Einstein
     </p>
     <p>
      "You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing things with logic. True power is restraint. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass." ~ Warren Buffett
     </p>
     <p>
      "We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy" ~ The Programmers' Credo (No idea who came up with this)
