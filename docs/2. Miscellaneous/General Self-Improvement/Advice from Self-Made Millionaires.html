     Anyone Can Do It
    </h2>
    <p class="has-drop-cap">
     <strong>
      Jason McGowan of Crumbl Cookies
     </strong>
     - Believed in his potential despite no baking experience.
- "I never imagined in my wildest dreams that we would do over $1 billion in sales," McGowan said. Crumbl became a billion-dollar company.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anne Mahlum of Solidcore
     </strong>
     - Emphasized persistence and hard work.
- "The biggest thing I’ve learned through Solidcore is: You can do whatever you want to do, as long as you’re willing to do it." She made $88.4 million from her business.
    </p>
    <h2 id="lean-into-what-makes-you-unique">
     Lean Into What Makes You Unique
    </h2>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anne Mahlum
     </strong>
     - Highlighted the importance of leveraging individual strengths and uniqueness for success.
- "I really believe in the power of uniqueness. When we... lean into our uniqueness, it really works in our favor, and it really has been a huge part of my success to do that personally and professionally."
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Edward Tirtanata of Kopi Kenangan
     </strong>
     - Advised entrepreneurs to differentiate themselves.
- "I think the best advice that I can give to fellow entrepreneurs is to be different. The next Starbucks is not going to look like a Starbucks, the next McDonald’s is not gonna look like a McDonald’s. The next Google is not going to look like a Google – you need to be radically different in order for you to compete against the incumbent." His coffee chain has over 800 locations and significant annual revenue.
    </p>
    <h2 id="be-passionate">
     Be Passionate
    </h2>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Shawn Tsao of Caviar
     </strong>
     - Stressed genuine passion for the product as a driving force through challenges.
- "If you’re an entrepreneur and you’re really passionate about the product that you’re building — not because you just want the glory of being a CEO or a founder [but] you’re really passionate about what you’re working on — that will get you through the hardest days." His passion for sandwiches led to a successful food-delivery service sold for over $100 million.
    </p>
    <h2 id="just-get-started">
     Just Get Started
    </h2>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jason McGowan and Anne Mahlum
     </strong>
     - Emphasized the importance of taking action and starting, even without complete resources or knowledge.
- "One of the biggest lessons that I’ve learned from starting Crumbl is just to get started. Whether you don’t have a mixer yet, or you don’t have a recipe for a cookie, you just get started — you start doing things, you start moving," McGowan shared.
- "Nike got it best, to ‘just do it.’ I have a phrase that says: ‘Just have a day one,’" Mahlum added. Early-stage action is crucial for building momentum.
