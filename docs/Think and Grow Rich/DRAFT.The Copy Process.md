# The Copy Process

TODO: Source copyright from beginning of book

This book has been manually retyped by me, Jeremy Harris, as a way to better familiarize myself with the book, after reading it through several times, and as a way to better prototype my content management system (CMS).

I have taken care to try to preserve the formatting from which I encountered it, including leaving the usage of several lengthy paragraphs, and punctuation errors, though I have taken the liberty to fix a few errors in spelling that I believe that I have encountered.
