          %BREADCRUMB_NAV% enables users to navigate to different directory paths
          
          This breadcrumb navigation is designed to help users navigate through the directory structure
          leading to the current document. These are known as the constituent paths.
          
          It displays the path hierarchy as follows:
          
          Example: /first_level/second_level/document.html

          turns into:

          `first_level` -> `second_level` -> `document_title` (as individual `breadcrumb` links)
